                <h2 class=" food-title">sandwich</h2>
                <p class="food-desc">A sandwich is a food typically consisting of vegetables, sliced cheese or meat,
                    placed on or between slices of bread, or more generally any dish wherein bread serves as a container
                    or wrapper for another food type.The sandwich began as a portable, convenient finger food in the
                    Western world, though over time it has become prevalent worldwide.</p>

                <h2 class="food-title">burger</h2>
                <p class="food-desc">A cheeseburger is a hamburger topped with cheese. Traditionally, the slice of
                    cheese is placed on top of the meat patty. The cheese is usually added to the cooking hamburger
                    patty shortly before serving, which allows the cheese to melt. Cheeseburgers can include variations
                    in structure, ingredients and composition. </p>

                <h2 class="food-title">Pizza</h2>
                <p class="food-desc">Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is an Italian dish consisting of
                    a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and
                    often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat,
                    etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>
